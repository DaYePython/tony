# refactor-playground Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change refactor-key-sequence-demo. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Use UnoCSS for Styling
The playground MUST use UnoCSS for styling instead of raw CSS files where possible.
#### Scenario: Developer runs dev server
Developer runs `pnpm dev`, styles are generated on demand.
#### Scenario: Utility classes usage
UI components use utility classes (e.g., `flex`, `p-4`, `text-red-500`).

### Requirement: Use VueUse for Logic
The playground MUST use `@vueuse/core` for common browser APIs and state management where applicable.
#### Scenario: Event listeners
Using `useEventListener` for keyboard events instead of manual `window.addEventListener`.

### Requirement: Component Decomposition
The `KeySequenceDemo.vue` MUST be split into smaller, focused components.
#### Scenario: Konami Card
`KonamiCard.vue` handles only the Konami code logic and display.
#### Scenario: Gamepad Card
`GamepadCard.vue` handles only the Gamepad logic and display.

### Requirement: Composable Logic
Business logic for sequence listening MUST be extracted into composables.
#### Scenario: useKeySequence
`useKeySequence` accepts a sequence and callbacks, returning status refs (`progress`, `activated`).

### Requirement: KeySequenceDemo Structure
`KeySequenceDemo.vue` MUST act as a layout/container component.
#### Scenario: Layout rendering
It renders `TabsRoot` from `reka-ui` and slots in the sub-components.
